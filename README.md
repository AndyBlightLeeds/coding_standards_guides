## Coding Standards and Style Guides

This is a short list of various resources that can be helpful in ensuring that Pipebots source code has a consistent look and feel, an idea originally floated by Andy Pickering.

They mainly consist of several `Style Guides` for the two most common languages used, `C` and `Python`. While the latter is pretty clear-cut, there are several options for the former. The main thing to remember is that we are talking about `C` in the context of embedded systems.

Additionally, a free (as in freedom) `Coding Standard` is included. Adhering to it will help reduce number of bugs in firmware with a small emphasis on safety.

Finally, just as an extra bit of information, are links to two popular documentation generator framewroks.
